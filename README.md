### Wiring Best Practices for High-Parallel Setups

**Applies to:** Teensy/ESP32/etc. driving WS2812/WS2813/SK6812 (1-wire) and APA102/clocked chips

<details>
<summary><b>📐 Critical Wiring Rules</b> - Eliminate flickering and corruption (Click to expand)</summary>

#### 1. Star/Bus Ground Architecture
- Tie every ground together: controller GND, each strip GND, PSU GNDs, shield/braid
- Use low-impedance connections (soldered/crimped, not tape-only)
- Keep ground paths short
- Verify: <20mV DC drop between controller and strip GNDs under load

**Why:** Data line voltage is measured against controller ground. Weak ground = corrupt bits.

#### 2. Twisted Pair: Data + Ground
- Run each data line twisted with its own ground wire end-to-end
- Use Cat5/6: one pair per output (data on one wire, other wire as return)
- Bond shield to GND at controller side if using shielded cable

**Why:** Minimizes EMI pickup/emissions and preserves signal integrity over distance.

#### 3. Level Shifting to 5V Logic
- 3.3V microcontrollers need level shifting for 5V LED strips
- Use **74HCT245** (8ch), **74HCT541** (8ch), or **74HCT125/126** (4ch) buffers
- Place **33–220Ω series resistors** at buffer output (before twisted pair)
- Keep buffers close to controller

**Why:** Restores full-swing logic and reduces ringing/reflections.

#### Example: 16-Output Teensy Setup
```
Grounds → ground bus → Teensy GND
Level shifters: 2× 74HCT245 (16 channels), powered at 5V
Per channel: Buffer → 33–100Ω → twisted pair → strip DIN/GND
At strip start: 1000µF cap across +5V/GND
Power injection as needed; keep data/power runs separate
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Signal issues?** Try underclocking: `FASTLED_OVERCLOCK=0.8` in `platformio.ini` build flags
- **Long runs failing?** Insert dummy LED near controller (set to black, offset array index)
- **Intermittent glitches?** Ensure all PSUs share the same AC circuit

#### Quick Do/Don't
- ✅ **Do:** Star/bus ground, twisted pairs, HCT buffers, source resistors, big cap at strip
- ❌ **Don't:** Float grounds, share one ground for many runs, use unbuffered 3.3V for long 5V lines

Following these practices eliminates 90% of "random sparkle/corruption" issues.

## 🚀 Platform-Specific Driver Configuration

---

## Teensy Platform

<details>
<summary><b>⚡ ObjectFLED Driver</b> - DEFAULT driver for Teensy 4.x with advanced parallel output</summary>

### Overview
The `ObjectFLED` driver is an advanced parallel output driver specifically optimized for Teensy 4.0 and 4.1 boards when using WS2812 LEDs. It provides **massive parallel output capacity** and is **enabled by default** on Teensy 4.x - no configuration needed!

### Parallel Output Capacity
- **Teensy 4.1**: Up to **50 parallel strips**
- **Teensy 4.0**: Up to **42 parallel strips**
- **Performance**: ~7x more strips than OctoWS2811

### Default Usage
```cpp
#include <FastLED.h>

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];
void setup() {
    // ObjectFLED is used automatically on Teensy 4.x
    FastLED.addLeds<WS2812, DATA_PIN, GRB>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
}
```

### Disabling ObjectFLED (Reverting to Legacy Driver)
If you encounter compatibility issues or wish to use the standard clockless driver instead of `ObjectFLED`, you can disable it by defining `FASTLED_NOT_USES_OBJECTFLED` before including the FastLED header:

```cpp
#define FASTLED_NOT_USES_OBJECTFLED
#include <FastLED.h>
```

### Re-enabling ObjectFLED (Explicitly)
While `ObjectFLED` is the default for Teensy 4.0/4.1, you can explicitly enable it (though not strictly necessary) using:

```cpp
#define FASTLED_USES_OBJECTFLED
#include <FastLED.h>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎯 WS2812Serial Driver</b> - High-performance serial-based LED control</summary>

### Overview
The `WS2812Serial` driver leverages serial ports for LED data transmission on Teensy boards, providing non-blocking operation and precise timing.

### Configuration
To use this driver, you must define `USE_WS2812SERIAL` before including the FastLED header.

```cpp
#define USE_WS2812SERIAL
#include <FastLED.h>
```

Then, use `WS2812SERIAL` as the chipset type in your `addLeds` call. The data pin is not used for this driver.

```cpp
FastLED.addLeds<WS2812SERIAL, /* DATA_PIN */, GRB>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
```

### Supported Pins & Serial Ports

## ESP32 Platform

<details>
<summary><b>🚀 ESP32 LCD Driver</b> - NEW! Memory-efficient parallel output using LCD peripheral (RECOMMENDED)</summary>

### Overview

The **LCD driver** is a high-performance parallel output driver for ESP32 boards with LCD peripheral support. It uses hardware LCD peripherals to drive up to **16 parallel WS28xx LED strips** with automatic chipset timing optimization.

**Two Driver Variants:**
- **I80 Mode**: Uses LCD_CAM/I80 peripheral with 3-word-per-bit encoding (6 bytes per bit)
- **RGB Mode**: Uses RGB LCD controller with 4-pixel-per-bit encoding (8 bytes per bit)

**Key Advantages over I2S:**
- ✅ **More WS282x Chipsets**: Better support for WS2811, WS2816, WS2813, etc.
- ✅ **Better timing accuracy**: Automatic PCLK optimization per chipset
- ✅ **Serial output works**: Unlike I2S, you can use Serial.print() for debugging
- ✅ **Platform-agnostic**: Automatically detects and uses available LCD peripheral

### Supported Platforms
- **ESP32-S3**: LCD_CAM peripheral with I80 interface (3-word encoding)
- **ESP32-P4**: Both RGB LCD controller (4-pixel encoding) AND I80 interface (3-word encoding)
- **Future ESP32 variants**: Any chip with RGB or I80 LCD peripheral support

### Configuration
To use the LCD driver instead of I2S, define `FASTLED_ESP32_LCD_DRIVER` before including FastLED:

```cpp
#define FASTLED_ESP32_LCD_DRIVER
#include <FastLED.h>

CRGB leds1[NUM_LEDS];
CRGB leds2[NUM_LEDS];

void setup() {
    // Standard FastLED API - LCD driver auto-selected
    FastLED.addLeds<WS2812, 2>(leds1, NUM_LEDS);  // WS2812 on pin 2
    FastLED.addLeds<WS2811, 4>(leds2, NUM_LEDS);  // WS2811 on pin 4 (slower timing)
}

void loop() {
    // Your LED code here
    FastLED.show();
}
```

**Without the define**, FastLED defaults to the I2S driver (legacy behavior).

### Performance
- **Up to 16 parallel strips** (all must use the same chipset)
- **Memory usage**:
  - I80 (S3): 144 KB per 1000 LEDs (6 bytes per bit)
  - RGB (P4): 192 KB per 1000 LEDs (8 bytes per bit)
- **Recommended for new projects** on ESP32-S3/P4

### Examples
- [Esp32S3I80 Example](examples/Esp32S3I80/) - Demonstrates LCD/I80 driver usage

**Note:** All parallel strips must use the same chipset timing. For per-strip timing control, use the RMT driver.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 ESP32-S3 I2S Driver</b> - Legacy parallel output using I2S peripheral</summary>

### Overview

The ESP32-S3 I2S driver leverages the I2S peripheral for high-performance parallel WS2812 output on ESP32-S3 boards. This driver is a dedicated clockless implementation.

**Note:** The **LCD driver** (above) is now recommended for new projects on ESP32-S3 due to better memory efficiency and Serial debugging support.

### Configuration
To use this driver, you must define `FASTLED_USES_ESP32S3_I2S` before including the FastLED header.

```cpp
#define FASTLED_USES_ESP32S3_I2S
#include <FastLED.h>
```

Then, use `WS2812` as the chipset type in your `addLeds` call. The data pin will be configured by the I2S driver.

```cpp
FastLED.addLeds<WS2812, DATA_PIN, GRB>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
```

**Note:** This driver requires a compatible Arduino-ESP32 core/IDF.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📡 Generic ESP32 I2S Driver</b> - Universal I2S support for ESP32</summary>

### Overview
The generic ESP32 I2S driver provides parallel WS2812 output for various ESP32 boards (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC). It uses the I2S peripheral for efficient data transmission.

### Configuration
To use this driver, you must define `FASTLED_ESP32_I2S` before including the FastLED header.

```cpp
#define FASTLED_ESP32_I2S
#include <FastLED.h>
```

Then, use `WS2812` as the chipset type in your `addLeds` call:

```cpp
FastLED.addLeds<WS2812, DATA_PIN, GRB>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
```

### DMA Buffer Configuration
For improved resilience under interrupt load (e.g., Wi-Fi activity), you can increase the number of I2S DMA buffers:

```cpp
#define FASTLED_ESP32_I2S_NUM_DMA_BUFFERS 4
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⚠️ ESP32 RMT Driver Configuration</b> - Critical performance and compatibility information</summary>

### ⚡ Performance Alert

**Important:** The RMT4 and RMT5 drivers use completely different APIs. FastLED's custom RMT4 driver is specifically optimized for LED control and significantly outperforms Espressif's generic RMT5 wrapper in terms of:
- **Performance**: Lower interrupt overhead and better timing precision
- **Wi-Fi resistance**: Dual-buffer design prevents flickering under Wi-Fi load
- **Efficiency**: Direct hardware control vs. abstraction layer overhead
- **Strip capacity**: RMT4 uses worker pools to support more LED strips; RMT5 lacks worker pools and is limited by hardware channels (particularly restrictive on ESP32-C3 with only 2 TX channels)

FastLED includes two RMT driver implementations:
- **RMT4 driver**: FastLED's custom, highly-optimized driver with direct RMT peripheral control
- **RMT5 driver**: Wrapper around Espressif's `led_strip` component (ESP-IDF 5.0+)

By default, FastLED automatically selects:
- **ESP-IDF 5.0+**: Uses RMT5 driver (for compatibility)
- **ESP-IDF 4.x and earlier**: Uses RMT4 driver

### Forcing RMT4 Driver (Recommended for Performance)

To force the use of FastLED's optimized RMT4 driver, you have two options:

**Option 1: Arduino IDE - Downgrade ESP32 Core**
- Use any ESP32 Arduino Core version below 3.0.
- These versions use ESP-IDF 4.x and below which defaults to RMT4

**Option 2: PlatformIO - Set Build Flag**

For ESP-IDF 5.0+ environments, set `FASTLED_RMT5=0` as a build flag:

```ini
[env:esp32]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
framework = arduino
lib_deps = fastled/FastLED
build_flags =
    -D FASTLED_RMT5=0
```

**📚 PlatformIO Users:** For a complete quick start guide with FastLED and PlatformIO, check out our official starter template: [github.com/fastled/platformio-starter](https://github.com/fastled/platformio-starter)

**⚠️ Critical:** RMT4 and RMT5 drivers cannot coexist in the same sketch. Espressif's ESP-IDF will cause a boot crash if it detects both drivers attempting to initialize. You must choose one or the other at compile time.

**Note:** Using RMT4 is strongly recommended if you experience flickering with Wi-Fi enabled or need maximum LED performance. RMT4 uses ESP-IDF's legacy RMT APIs which are still maintained for backward compatibility in ESP-IDF 5.x, though marked as deprecated.

## Silicon Labs (MGM240/EFR32MG24) Platform

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 ezWS2812 GPIO Driver</b> - Optimized bit-banging with cycle-accurate timing</summary>

### Overview
The `EZWS2812_GPIO` driver uses optimized GPIO bit-banging with cycle-accurate timing calibrated for 39MHz and 78MHz CPU frequencies. This driver is **always available** and requires no hardware peripherals.

### Performance
- ~400Hz refresh rate
- No hardware peripheral consumption
- Optimized assembly-level timing

### Usage
```cpp
#include <FastLED.h>

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];
void setup() {
    // GPIO-based controller on pin 7
    FastLED.addLeds<EZWS2812_GPIO, 7, GRB>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⚡ ezWS2812 SPI Driver</b> - Hardware-accelerated maximum performance</summary>

### Overview
The `EZWS2812_SPI` driver provides hardware SPI acceleration for maximum performance (~1000Hz refresh rate). This driver **consumes a hardware SPI peripheral** and must be explicitly enabled.

### Why Opt-In Required
Following the same pattern as ObjectFLED for Teensy, the SPI controller must be explicitly enabled to prevent accidentally consuming the SPI peripheral that may be needed for other components (SD cards, displays, sensors).

### Configuration
**Required define before including FastLED:**
```cpp
#define FASTLED_USES_EZWS2812_SPI  // MUST be before #include
#include <FastLED.h>

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];
void setup() {
    // SPI-based controller (consumes hardware SPI)
    FastLED.addLeds<EZWS2812_SPI, GRB>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
}
```

### Performance
- ~1000Hz refresh rate (2.5x faster than GPIO)
- Hardware-accelerated
- Consumes one SPI peripheral

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>ℹ️ Important Notes</b> - Compatibility and limitations</summary>

### Supported Boards
- Arduino Nano Matter
- SparkFun Thing Plus Matter
- Seeed Xiao MG24 Sense

### LED Compatibility
The `EZWS2812_GPIO` and `EZWS2812_SPI` controllers are optimized specifically for **WS2812 LEDs only**. For other LED chipsets (SK6812, TM1809, UCS1903, etc.), FastLED automatically uses the generic clockless driver which supports all timing variants but with standard performance.

### Driver Source
These drivers are based on the Silicon Labs ezWS2812 library and provide seamless FastLED API compatibility with enhanced performance for MG24-based boards.

</details>

**Note:** All I2S lanes must share the same chipset/timings. If per-lane timing differs, consider using the RMT driver instead.
